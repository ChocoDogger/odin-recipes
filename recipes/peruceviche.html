    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ceviche is a traditional Peruvian fish dish marinated in citrus fruits and typically served with sweet potatoes and Andean corn. Essential ingredients include fresh fish like mackerel, sardine, or grouper, and a strong chili pepper such as aji. The dish is known for its refreshing and tangy flavors, making it a popular choice in Peruvian cuisine.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 fresh fish fillets (e.g., around 500g red snapper, sea bass, or sole)</li>
        <li>1 red onion</li>
        <li>1 chili pepper</li>
        <li>6 to 8 limes</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>25g fresh coriander</li>
        <li>3 cm fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>1 cup ice</li>
        <li>1 medium sweet potato</li>
        <li>Salt & pepper</li>
        <li>Optional: 2 to 3 cooked king prawns</li>
        <li>Optional: 2 tbsp Aji Amarillo paste</li>
        <li>Optional: 1 tbsp Rocoto Chili paste (or use 1 tbsp Cholula sauce)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Wash and dry the fish. Cut the fish into cubes of approximately 2 cm. Remove any remaining skin, scales, or spines.</p></li>
        <li><p>Wash the lemons and limes. Squeeze them into a large bowl. Strain the fresh lime and lemon juice to remove any seeds.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place the fish cubes into the juice marinade. Ensure all the flesh is covered by the juice. Cover the container and store in the fridge for about 20 to 30 minutes. Use some ice cubes to cool the fish faster. Occasionally check that the fish is “cooking” and turn gently so that each piece gets plenty of contact with the lime juice.</p></li>
        <li><p>While the fish is marinating, thinly slice the red onion and soak in cold water for 10 minutes to reduce its sharpness. Drain and set aside.</p></li>
        <li><p>Once the fish is opaque and firm, drain the excess juice. Mix in the sliced red onion, chopped chili pepper, minced garlic, grated ginger, and chopped fresh coriander. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p></li>
        <li><p>Boil the sweet potato until tender, then slice. Serve the ceviche chilled, accompanied by slices of sweet potato. Optionally, garnish with cooked king prawns and add Aji Amarillo or Rocoto Chili paste for extra flavor.</p></li>
    </ol>
