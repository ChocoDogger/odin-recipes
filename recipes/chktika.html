    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken Tikka Masala is a classic curried dish with soft tender chunks of char-grilled chicken, simmered briefly in a delicious & super aromatic sauce/gravy. The dish comprises of two components â€“ first is tikka and the other is the masala, which is the gravy or sauce in which the tikkas are simmered. This world popular dish has its origin from Northern India, where tikka kebabs were cooked in a tandoor consisting of live charcoal or wood fire. These are served as an appetizer with coriander/ Cilantro Chutney and Mint Chutney. However, tikka masala sauce/gravy is said to be a fusion Indian-British curry, popularized by the Indian Chefs, working in Britain.</p>
