    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Costillar Argentino, or Argentine beef ribs, is a traditional dish prepared during an asado, the Argentine barbecue. The ribs are seasoned with a coarse mix of salt, pepper, sweet chili, and oregano, then grilled slowly over a wood fire, allowing the flavors to develop and the meat to become tender and juicy.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>Dried oregano</li>
